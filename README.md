# The application of locally-compensated ridge geographically weighted regression models to understand the drivers house price in Hà Nội, Vietnam


# Abstract 

This paper describes the joint application of two methodological advances to geographically weighted regression (GWR) in order to construct a model of house price in Hà Nội, Vietnam: (i) the use of locally compensated ridge GWR to overcome local collinearity in the predictor variables; and (ii) the incorporation of road network distances (rather than the usual Euclidean distance) to better reflect the distance decay of socio-economic drivers. The analyses compare the outputs of GWR models with and without these advances and shows the best model to be one that includes both – i.e. GWR with a local ridge term calibrated with road network distances. Models are applied to a survey dataset that captured variables describing property, household and neighborhood characteristics, linked to Status Quality Trade Off (SQTO) theory. The best performing model includes qualitative variables relating to social status, the social desirability of local areas, as well as variables describing building characteristics - as are classically used in hedonic house price modelling. It uses road network distance to construct its local regressions rather than Euclidean distance and quantifies the effect of some of the more intangible processes and perceptions related to house price and demand. The analyses quantify the spatially varying impact of these explanatory variables on house price in Hà Nội. The paper demonstrates the importance of considering how processes and statistical relationships vary over space and critically the importance of considering and testing for local collinearity even where none is found to exist globally. The discussion considers the complimentary nature of SQTO and GWR, and reflects on how such approaches support temporally dynamic house price models to forecasts the locations and magnitude of house price bubbles.
