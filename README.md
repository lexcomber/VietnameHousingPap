# Abstract 

This paper describes the application of 2 methodological advances to geographically weighted regression (GWR) approaches in order to construct a model of house price in Hà Nội, Vietnam: the use of locally compensated ridge GWR (LCR-GWR) to overcome local collinearity in the predictor variables; and the incorporation of road network distances (rather than the usual Euclidean distance) to better reflect the distance decay of socio-economic drivers. The analyses compare the outputs of models with and without these advances and shows the best model to be one that includes LCR-GWR and road network distances. These are applied to a survey dataset that captured variables describing property, household and neighborhood characteristics, linked to Status Quality Trade Off (SQTO) theory through GWR approaches. The model includes qualitative variables relating to social status, the social desirability of local areas, as well as variables describing building characteristics as are classically used in hedonic house price modelling. It uses road network distance to construct the local models rather than Euclidean distance and quantifies the effect of some of the more intangible processes and perception related to house price and demand. The final analyses quantifies the spatially varying impact of these variables on house price in Hà Nội. the paper demonstrates the importance of considering how processes and statistical relationships vary over space and critically the importance of considering and testing for local collinearity even where none is found to exist globally. The discussion considers the complimentary nature of SQTO and GWR and reflects on how such approaches support temporally dynamic house price models to forecasts the locations and magnitude of house price bubbles.
